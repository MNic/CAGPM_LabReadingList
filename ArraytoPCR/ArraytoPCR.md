##Array Signature to qPCR Assays

###Convert Array to Hydrolysis Probe Assays

1. Generate List of significantly associated microarray probes
2. Supply the list of probe IDs to Life Tech's [Assay Selection Tool](https://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-assays.html "Assay Selection")
3. Check assays selected against transcripts of interest from the array probe IDs.  Match amplicon/hydrolysis probe location with microarray probe location where possible.
