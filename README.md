###Background on qPCR

Authors worth reviewing: [Michael W. Pfaffl](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Pfaffl "Pfaffl"), [Stephen A. Bustin](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Bustin2 "Bustin"), [Jo Vandesompele](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jo_Vandesompele "Vandesompele"), [Jan Hellemans](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Hellemans "Hellemans")

* [How to do successful gene expression analysis using real-time PCR](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202309002461 "Vandesompele") - This is a great introduction and overview for qPCR method and Experimental Design.
* [MIQE Guidelines](http://www.clinchem.org/content/55/4/611.long "MIQE") -  Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments.  In an effort to increase the reproducibility of Real-Time PCR, Bustin *et al* produced a comprehensive list of requirements (and recommendations) around information required for the publication of qPCR data.  These include everything from Experimental Design considerations to Primer locations and sequences.
	* [MIQE Practical Implementation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2955025/ "MIQE Practical") - Recommendations around adoption of MIQE guidelines in a real-world laboratory setting
* [qBase relative quantification framework](http://genomebiology.com/content/8/2/R19 "qBase+") - Too broad ranging to fit in anything but background; this summarizes the PCR experimentation process (GeNorm and Relative Expression Analysis included) used in qBase+ software.  The recommendations in this publication are extremely important to the implementation of PCR protocols whether using qBase+ or not.

###PCR Math

* [Accurate Normalization of qPCR by geometric averaging of multiple internal controls](http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/7/research/0034/ "GeNorm") - Selection of and Normalization math around reference assay selection for qPCR.  This addresses why multiple stable internal controls are better than one, and provides all of the equations necessary to perform the calculations.
